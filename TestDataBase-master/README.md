This application is written in Java 8 with the IDE Intellij, the project shows how to connect to a local Database, it uses the sqlite.jdbc library. The code executes several SQL queries with the commands create, set, insert into, update, delete. I followed the Tim Buchalka's "Java Programming Masterclass covering Java 11 & Java 17 -Udemy".
